# Multi-Cluster Kubernetes envrionnement

Multi-Cluster Kubernetes envrionnement is a set of tools for deploying a cloud-native simulation platform consisting of multiple Kubernetes clusters created on demand. The tools are written in Python and require Docker, Kubernetes, Kind, Submariner, Helm, and Calicoctl.

In this platform, we will be using several tools and technologies to create and manage Kubernetes clusters. Specifically, we will use Kind, which is a tool that allows running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers. Calico will be used to implement the Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) as a plug-in and to provide agents for Kubernetes to provide networking for containers and pods. Additionally, Submariner will enable direct networking between Pods and Services in different Kubernetes clusters.

For deploying various tools and services, we will use Helm. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and upgrade complex applications. Using Helm, we will deploy monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Thanos to monitor the Kubernetes clusters. We will also use Helm for deploying network functions on the different clusters.

## Directory Structure

The main directory contains two subdirectories:

- `scripts`: Contains all scripts used for creating and configuring Kubernetes clusters.
- `config`: Contains the configuration files generated by the scripts.

## Installation

To use this platforme, you need to have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
- [Submariner](https://submariner.io/getting-started/installation/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [Calicoctl](https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/clis/calicoctl/install)


Once the tools are installed, you can clone the repository.

## Usage

To use Kind Automatisation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository on your machine using the command `git clone https://gitlab.tech.orange/equipeteam/rl-multi-domain-for-multi-placement`
2. Navigate to the `kind_automatisation/scripts` directory.
